# Guitar-Song-Simplifier-Script
A WIP repo for scripts I'm building for a personal project focused on simplifying guitar songs.

The long-term goal is to develop a full-stack application.
A user will be able to upload any song, and have its timestamped chords and beats extracted and visualized as a roadmap, along with transcribed lyrics.
The user can then play their guitar along with the analyzed upload of the song, and have their own chords, times and beats processed in real time to see how well they match with the analyzed upload.

This is meant to be used a tool that makes it easier to learn and play a new song on guitar, especially in terms of syncing rhythm and singing.
